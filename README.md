Hello fellow earthlings!

David here, I like learning and gaining new skill sets. I have decided to learn information about technology, data and the likes in order to transition into a career field that I have always found interesting. During my formative years, I was unable to study what I was passionate about. Then, I went to college and found myself as a business major. I was able to take a few MSIS courses that piqued my curiousity back from high school. However, I was too far along in accounting to change, especially since I had changed majors from chemical engineering once before. After experiencing the real life roles in accounting and the people within the industry, I have decided that I should follow my heart and not end up hating my life thanks to my job and those around me. Thankfully, I have the chance to do that before it is too late.
